    <!-- First stanza of the poem -->
    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
        Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
        Then there's a pair of us!<br>
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>

    <!-- Second stanza of the poem -->
    <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
        How public - like a Frog -<br>
        To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!</p>
